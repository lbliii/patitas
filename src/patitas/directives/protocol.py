"""DirectiveHandler protocol for extensible block-level directives.

Directives are the primary extension mechanism for block-level markup.
Implement the DirectiveHandler protocol to create custom directives.

Thread Safety:
Handlers must be stateless. All state should be in the AST node
or passed as arguments. Multiple threads may call the same handler
instance concurrently.

Example:
    >>> class NoteDirective:
    ...     names = ("note",)
    ...
    ...     def parse(self, name, title, options, content, children, location):
    ...         return Directive(location, name, title, options, children)
    ...
    ...     def render(self, node, rendered_children, sb):
    ...         sb.append('<div class="admonition note">')
    ...         sb.append(rendered_children)
    ...         sb.append('</div>')

        names: Tuple of directive names this handler responds to.
               Example: ("note", "warning", "tip") for admonitions
